# Pitch Class Set Analyzer v0.5

This is a proof-of-concept (learning React!) application.  It takes a pitch class set via a visual keyboard input, and returns the set in normal form, prime form, its interval class vector, and its Forte name.  Normal form, prime form, and IC vector are computed; Forte name is looked up (as is tradition).

The visual keyboard input is provided from [react-piano](https://github.com/kevinsqi/react-piano).

The final version will include an audio "explorer" which plays permutations of the pitch set class in varying combinations.

Need an introduction to pitch class sets, atonal theory, and computing these numbers the musical way?
