# Pitch Class Set Analyzer v0.5

This is a proof-of-concept (learning React!) application.  It takes a pitch class set via a visual keyboard input, and returns the set in normal form, prime form, its interval class vector, and its Forte name.  Normal form, prime form, and IC vector are computed; Forte name is looked up (as is tradition).

The visual keyboard input is provided from [react-piano](https://github.com/kevinsqi/react-piano).

The final version will include an audio "explorer" which plays permutations of the pitch set class in varying combinations.
